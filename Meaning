What is Smart Contract? 
What does the term "Smart Contract" mean? Actually, computer scientist Nick Szabo came up with the term in 1994. He provided the following definition for "smart contract": "a computerised transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract."  The Ethereum Blockchain, which uses Solidity as its primary programming language, is what enables the Smart Contract to become a reality today.
